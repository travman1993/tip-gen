                    <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                    <p>Cookies are small text files that are stored on your device (computer, tablet, or smartphone) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work more efficiently, improve your user experience, and provide information to website owners.</p>
                    <p>Cookies serve many purposes, such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Remembering your preferences and settings.</li>
                        <li>Tracking your activity to improve user experience.</li>
                        <li>Displaying personalized content and advertisements.</li>
                        <li>Analyzing how users interact with a website.</li>

                    <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
                    <p>What Do I TIP uses cookies and similar technologies in the following ways:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Essential Cookies</h3>
                    <p>These cookies are necessary for the Site to function properly. They enable core functionality such as storing your cookie consent preference so we don't repeatedly show the cookie banner.</p>

                    <h3>Local Storage</h3>
                    <p>In addition to cookies, we use browser local storage to save your "Who Pays the Bill?" spinner names. This allows your name list to persist even after you close your browser, so you don't have to re-enter names every time you visit.</p>

                    <h3>Analytics Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We may use analytics tools (if enabled) to understand how users interact with our Site. This includes information about which pages are visited, how long you stay on each page, and which features are most popular. This data helps us improve our services and user experience.</p>

                    <h3>Advertisement Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We display placeholder ad spaces on our Site. Third-party ad providers may use cookies to serve targeted advertisements based on your browsing history. These ad cookies are controlled by the ad networks, not by What Do I TIP directly.</p>

                    <p><strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Set by ad networks and analytics providers to serve ads and track user behavior across multiple websites.</p>
                    <p><strong>Session Cookies:</strong> Temporary cookies that are deleted when you close your browser.</p>
                    <p><strong>Persistent Cookies:</strong> Cookies that remain on your device for a set period of time or until you manually delete them.</p>
