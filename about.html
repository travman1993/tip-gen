                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>We've all been there: sitting at a restaurant table, phone calculator in hand, struggling to figure out a fair tip. Do you go 15% or 20%? How do you split the bill when everyone ordered different things? And then there's the eternal question: who pays when the bill arrives?</p>
                    <p>What Do I TIP was created to solve these everyday dilemmas. We believe tipping should be simple, fair, and even fun. Our mission is to take the stress out of tipping and bill splitting, so you can focus on enjoying your meal and company.</p>

                        <li><strong>Calculate tips instantly:</strong> Choose from standard percentages or enter a custom amount. We handle the math so you don't have to.</li>
                        <li><strong>Split bills fairly:</strong> Divide the total bill and tip among your group in seconds. No more awkward disputes about who owes what.</li>
                        <li><strong>Decide who pays:</strong> Our fun name spinner brings a little randomness and humor to the age-old question of who picks up the check.</li>

                    <h2>Why We Started This</h2>
                    <p>Tipping culture is evolving, and many people feel uncertain about what's expected. Whether you're dining at a fancy restaurant, ordering delivery, or grabbing coffee, our goal is to provide a simple, judgment-free way to calculate fair tips. We believe service workers deserve recognition for their hard work, and we want to help you express that appreciation easily.</p>
                    <p>The spinner feature adds a touch of fun to group dining. Instead of the same person always volunteering (or avoiding) to pay, let chance decide. It's a playful way to keep things interesting.</p>
